# Generating word cloud of most frequent words in messages
# By Johan WÃ¥llgren 201804

# NOTE: The plot window (the acctual window) in RStudio needs to be lagre in size when generatin word cloud.
# If you get warnings saying  "...could not be fit on page. It will not be plotted..." make the window lagrer.
